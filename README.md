# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting üìàüìâ

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock data from the **National Stock Exchange (NSE)** for **Kotak Mahindra Bank Pvt. Ltd.**, one of India's largest private sector banks. Using the ARIMA method, we aim to understand stock performance over the years, visualize patterns and trends, build a predictive model for future stock prices, and evaluate its performance. The project combines data storytelling with robust forecasting techniques to provide insights into stock price movements.

## Objectives üìú
1. **Analyze Stock Performance**: Explore stock data to understand trends and patterns over time.
2. **Visualization**: Create meaningful graphs and visualizations to illustrate stock attributes with a storytelling approach.
3. **Forecasting**: Build an ARIMA-based time series model to predict stock prices.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the forecasting model to ensure its reliability.

## Dataset üìä
The dataset contains historical stock price data for **Kotak Mahindra Bank Pvt. Ltd.**, including attributes such as:
- **Date**: The trading date.
- **Open**: The opening stock price for the day.
- **High**: The highest stock price of the day.
- **Low**: The lowest stock price of the day.
- **Close**: The closing stock price for the day.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded.

### Context üîç
Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited is a leading banking and financial services provider in India. As of November 2021:
- It is the **third largest private sector bank in India** by assets and market capitalization.
- The bank operates **1,600 branches** and **2,519 ATMs** across the country.
- This stock dataset offers an opportunity to analyze the performance of this significant financial institution.

## Methods and Tools ‚öíÔ∏è
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values using Python libraries like `missingo`.
   - Cleaned and formatted the dataset for time series analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Created line plots and bar charts to visualize stock trends.
   - Analyzed key metrics like closing prices and trading volumes.
3. **Time Series Modeling**:
   - Built and fine-tuned an **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model for forecasting.
   - Used `pmdarima` for model selection and parameter tuning.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
5. **Visualization**:
   - Generated graphs and static images for storytelling, as GitHub does not support dynamic images.
